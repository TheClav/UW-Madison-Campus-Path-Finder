# UW-Madison Campus Path Finder

## Backend and Frontend of a fully functioning program that implents Dijkstras algorithm in Java to find the shortest path between two buildings.

This is the code for the Front/Backend Interfaces and the Front/Backend. My apologies for not including my implementation of Dijkstras Algoritm, but my professor
doesnt want other students copying it. I am responsible for the code of the Backend Interface and the Backend. There are three mehtods in my Backend. The first 
allows for a dot file to be passed in the form of a string and then read off to make a directed graph. The second finds the shortest path given two locations and 
the thrid displayes a summary of all the buldings, paths, and costs. These results are then passed to the Frontend which are then displayed. The Frontend code creates
a display and then changes based on various inputs.
