# UW-Madison Campus Path Finder

## Backend/Frontend of a fully functioning program that implents Dijkstras algorithm in Java to find the shortest path between two buildings.

This is the code for the Front/Backend Interfaces and the Front/Backend. My apologies for not including my implementation of Dijkstras Algoritm, but my professor doesnt want other students copying it. I am responsible for the code of the Backend Interface, Path Interface, Shortest Path, and the Backend. There are three mehtods in my Backend. The first allows for a dot file to be passed in the form of a string and then read off to make a directed graph. The second finds the shortest path given two locations and the thrid displayes a summary of all the buldings, paths, and costs. These results are then passed to the Frontend which are then displayed. The Shortest path class implements the path interface and just has some getter mehtods for: the shortest path in the form of a list, the walking times as a double, and the pathcost as a double.

*See the Shortest-Path_demo.mp4 file above for a full demonstation of the functionaliy*

## Code that is used in the functionality but not included
1) GraphADT Interface
2) MapADT Interface
3) PlaceholderMap Class
(This was the code for the directed graph which wasn't written by me)
